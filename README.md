# Cervical-Cancer-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project developed a deep learning system for cervical cancer detection using transfer learning with ResNet50, MobileNet, and DenseNet models. Trained on diverse cervical cancer images with data augmentation, it aimed to improve model performance and precision for early diagnosis, addressing limitations of traditional screening methods.

## Objectives:
- Develop a deep learning model for cervical cancer detection using transfer learning with ResNet50, MobileNet, and DenseNet.
- Enhance model accuracy and precision for early detection, reducing false positives and negatives.
- Overcome limitations of traditional screening methods.
- Support early diagnosis to improve patient survival, especially in resource-limited settings.

## Implementation:
- Accuracy: Measure the model's overall classification accuracy.
- Precision and Recall: Evaluate the ability to correctly identify and detect cancer cases.
- F1 Score: Balance between precision and recall for optimal performance.
- AUC-ROC: Assess the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.
- Data Augmentation Impact: Evaluate improvements from techniques like rotation and scaling.
- Training and Inference Time: Measure model efficiency for real-time use.
- Confusion Matrix: Analyze false positives and negatives to ensure reliability.
